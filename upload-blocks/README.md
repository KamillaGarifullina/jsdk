## üç∞ Concept description
There are so many use cases and many workflows for file uploading... Is it possible to create uploading solution to fit them all? We believe - yes, with a power of (Custom Elements standard)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements] and our widget-specific open source (Symbiote.js)[https://github.com/symbiotejs/symbiote.js] library.
You can use high-level simple HTML and CSS to customize layouts and define the most popular scenarios. You can create your onw blocks from scratch with JavaScript using our super-duper base-class.
* easy to use within any modern toolchain: framework, library or CMS
* livesycle is controlled from inside, you don't need to manage it in your code
* you can easyly switch between incapsulated secure styling and common document styles
* very easy to set any customized data context for the blocks, to controll them in details
* total flexibility
* no any performance-expensive libraries or heavy dependencies needed
* so you have a strict design guides... not a problem anymore!
* everything is very close to native browser API's, you don't need to learn something compleatly new

  <h2>Demo:</h2>

  <uc-default-widget 
    css-src="../upload-blocks/build/uc-basic.css">
  </uc-default-widget>

  <div>&nbsp;</div>

  <uc-default-widget
    ctx-name="UPLDR2"
    style="--darkmode:1"
    css-src="../upload-blocks/build/uc-basic.css">
  </uc-default-widget>

## üè† Integration basics
Integration HTML-code example:
```html
<uc-default-widget 
  style="--cfg-pubkey:'demopublickey'"
  css-src="../upload-blocks/themes/uc-basic/index.css">
</uc-default-widget>
```
As you can see, some of widget settings are passed via CSS variables. That means you can use styles, CSS-classes and dedicated CSS-files to pass any setting to any block or redefine if using native DOM API or just HTML.

> You shold obtain a Public API Key in your (Uploadcare project's dashboard)[https://app.uploadcare.com/] to use file uploading features. For demo-only purposes you can use `demopublickey` instead.
