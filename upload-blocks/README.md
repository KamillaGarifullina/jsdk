# &lt;upload-blocks&gt;

## üß© Bulld you own file uploading flow with the set of pre-defined custom elements!

> Or dive deeper and create your own beautiful blocks!

## üç∞ Concept description
There are so many use cases and many workflows for file uploading... Is it possible to create uploading solution to fit them all? 

We believe - yes, with a power of [Custom Elements standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) and our widget-specific open source [Symbiote.js](https://github.com/symbiotejs/symbiote.js) library.

You can use high-level simple HTML and CSS to customize layouts and define the most popular scenarios. You can create your onw blocks from scratch with JavaScript using our super-duper [BlockComponent base-class](./docs/block-component.html).

* Easy to use within any modern toolchain: framework, library or CMS
* Livesycle is controlled from inside, you don't need to manage it in your code
* You can easyly switch between encapsulated secure styling and common document styles. Using of Shadow DOM - is up to you
* Very easy to set any customized data context for the blocks, to controll them in details
* Total flexibility
* No any performance-expensive libraries or heavy dependencies needed
* So you have a strict design guides... not a problem anymore!
* Sverything is very close to native browser API's, you don't need to learn something compleatly new
* [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) friendly - good for secure enterprise usage
* [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) friendly: enter the new world of web-development

## üè† Integration basics

We use [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) standard to make our solution integration seamless. It allows us to use simple HTML-code to define layouts and place our widgets into the any other templates.

[Custom Elements Everywhere](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/)

Integration HTML-code example:
```html
<uc-default-widget
  style="--cfg-pubkey:'demopublickey'"
  css-src="../upload-blocks/themes/uc-basic/index.css">
</uc-default-widget>
```
As you can see, some of widget settings are passed via CSS variables. That means you can use styles, CSS-classes and dedicated CSS-files to pass any setting to any block or redefine if using native DOM API or just HTML.

> You shold obtain a Public API Key in your [Uploadcare project's dashboard](https://app.uploadcare.com/) to use file uploading features. 

For demo-only purposes you can use `demopublickey` instead.
