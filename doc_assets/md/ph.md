### Our development culture & philosophy

* We don't use JavaScript if it can be made with HTML+CSS only
* We think twice and more before adding one more dependency
* We prefer to use native platform abilities instead of one more JS-library
* We use the latest web-platform APIs
* We use HTML for top-level composition in our solutions

* We use code references both for documentation and tests
* We highly focused on security
* We don't follow the hype, we creating mainstream for the future
