# Uploadcare SDK for JavaScript developers

<re-htm src="./doc_assets/htm/doc-nav.htm"><re-htm>

## üíé Core concepts

* All in one place: here, you can find everything you need to build a modern and reliable web application with Uploadcare on board.
* Modern technologies: web components, service workers, wasm, and other cutting edge web standards are ready to show their power.
* Type safety with a JSDoc declaration and TypeScript static analysis.
* Modern ESM-level code sharing.
* Build stage is unnecessary for development: use the code directly in any modern browser or node.js.
* Fast and secure.
* Minimum of external dependencies: security audit is not expensive.
* We are trying to be as close to the native web platform as possible and not force you to use any specific development environment tools.
* Tested by un Uploadcare community.

## üì¶ What‚Äôs in the box?

* [uploader](./uploader/) - file uploader implementations for the most frequent use cases.
* [upload-blocks](./upload-blocks/) - build your own uploading flow with the simple HTML and CSS.
* Adaptive image delivery tools: all you need to distribute your web images efficiently.
* File uploading client library: handle files from browser or node.
* Web components for media content representation: audio, video, image galleries, etc.
* Cloud image editing tools: tune your pictures on the fly.
* Common purpose components and tools.
* etc.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and start

1. Clone repository: `git clone git@github.com:uploadcare/jsdk.git ./`.
2. Run dependencies setup: `npm run setup`.
3. Start local dev-server: `npm run dev`.

## Typescript support

We use [JSDoc type annotations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro-to-js-ts.html) for TypeScript static analysis support during development. 

Also we provide type definitions ([*.d.ts files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/dts-from-js.html)) for the TypeScript projects in our packages.

Check the [JSDoc Reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) page in TypeScript official documentation.
